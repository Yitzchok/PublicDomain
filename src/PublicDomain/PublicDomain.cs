// ======================================
// The purpose of the PublicDomain package is to solve two problems or annoyances
// of .NET development:
// 
// 1. .NET projects and utilities are scattered, difficult to
// deploy and integrate, difficult to find, difficult to contribute to, and
// 2. Licenses are confusing and/or restrictive
// 
// This package solves these two problems as follows:
// 
// 1. This package becomes a "catch all" for all different types of code,
// so that there is no dependency hierarchy, and
// 
// 2. This code is in the Public Domain (http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-definitions.html),
// meaning that the code has no legal authority, will ask nothing for its use, and
// has absolutely no restrictions! That is true open source. It may be included
// in commercial applications, redistributed, altered, or even eaten without any worries.
// Its use need not be attributed in any way. This package is inherently provided
// 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will any authors
// be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this package.
// 
// Any additions to this file must not introduce non-Public Domain code, or code
// that must be externally attributed in any way (i.e. attributed by consumers of this package).
// If you have taken code from someone else which has a similar license and
// does not require external attribution, make sure with the author that this
// is truly a proper place for the code, that external attribution is not necessary,
// and finally make sure to internally attribute the code with a #region to the author(s).
//
// NOTE: Some code documentation may appear wrongly worded. This is due to auto-documentation
// using GhostDoc (http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/).
